<!-- prettier-ignore -->
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) template bootstrapped from [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). It's configured for the following out of the box:

- [Next.js](https//nextjs.org) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Mantine Hooks & Components Library](https//mantine.dev) for a great looking UI with tons of useful pre-built hooks
- [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) support
- [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) + [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library)
- [Plop.js](https://github.com/plopjs/plop) for creating new components, pages, etc. from templates

## About

There are many great templates out there for settings up a web development project, but there always tends to be a few things I want that are missing from all of them. **Main Course** aims to solve this by front-loading more tools and configurations into a template, with less tinkering required. It is built to my own personal preferences, so your mileage may vary.

## Features

Main Course follows a common React project style:

```bash
public/
  images/
  favicon
src/
  assets/
  components/
  pages/
  styles/
  utils/
test/
```

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

Main Course is offered under an MIT license.
